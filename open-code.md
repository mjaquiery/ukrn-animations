Many researchers use software in their work.
When this software is shared freely and openly, people can use the software, [community] check one another's work, and contribute to improving it.
Open Source Software is software that has an open license, allowing people to inspect the code inside it. Most Open Source Software can be modified and shared, too.

During data analysis, researchers turn raw data into interpretable results.
Although researchers try to describe this process carefully when they publish a study, there is never room to describe everything exactly.
By publishing analysis scripts with an Open Source license, researchers can show exactly how their raw data lead to the results they report.
This allows other researchers to inspect 

Computational reproducibilty means being able get exactly the same results from the same raw data each time by making sure the steps in between are exactly the same.
If researchers publish their analysis scripts with an Open Source license, other researchers can look through those scripts and
